# üîó AbellFi: ICP-Powered Decentralized Trading Infrastructure

AbellFi is a non-open-source, AI-driven crypto investment platform that integrates deeply with the **Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)**. It enables secure, decentralized, and automated cross-chain trading powered by ICP smart contracts (canisters), with built-in ECDSA signing and multi-wallet support.

This repository contains the **canister logic** powering our backend infrastructure, including transaction management, EVM wallet generation, and cross-chain execution‚Äîleveraging features like **HTTPS outcalls**, **ECDSA signatures**, and **Chain Fusion**.

## üåê Project Overview

AbellFi democratizes access to institutional-grade crypto investment strategies by combining:

- **Decentralized execution on Internet Computer**
- **AI-driven investment models**
- **Cross-chain trade support**
- **Secure, self-custodial wallet management**

Our primary goal is to make advanced trading strategies available to all crypto users while ensuring transparency, security, and decentralization through ICP.

## ‚úÖ Milestones & Progress

### Milestone 1

- [x] Integrated IdentityKit (Internet Identity) for user authentication  
- [x] Linked user sessions in Django using ICP principals  
- [x] Demoed complete login/authentication flow  

### Milestone 2

- [x] Developed Django service layer to interface with ICP canisters using `ic-py`  
- [x] Created event queue + worker architecture for trade event processing  
- [x] Simulated and passed stress tests for 50K concurrent users  
- [x] Demoed end-to-end trade execution via Plug wallet and ICP canisters  

### Milestone 3

- [x] Developed ECDSA-based canister logic for deriving user EVM wallets  
- [x] Integrated Polygon chain support via Chain Fusion (ic-alloy)  
- [x] Implemented key canister methods:  
  - `approve_token`  
  - `swap_token`  
  - `swap_token_admin`  
  - `withdraw_erc_20`  
  - `withdraw_native_token`  
- [x] Connected these methods to Django backend and frontend UI  
- [x] Demoed cross-chain transaction from login ‚Üí execution ‚Üí confirmation on dashboard

## üí° How It Works

### Run Locally

```bash
# Start the local replica
dfx start --background

# Deploy canisters
dfx deploy

# (Optional) Generate candid interface
npm run generate

# Start frontend dev server
npm start
Access frontend at: http://localhost:8080

Access replica at: http://localhost:4943?canisterId=<your_canister_id>

Frontend Environment Notes
If deploying frontend without DFX:

Set DFX_NETWORK=ic manually

Override process.env.DFX_NETWORK in declarations if needed

Optionally, set env_override in dfx.json
